Decoupling Logic From Presentation

Generally, aim to have components to be one of two types:

Presentational
    Dosen't have state; is primarily about appearance / UI

Logical
    Has state or related logic; isn't about a specific UI

States / data can be passed downward, they cannot be passed upwards
Props can only be passed downward to other components

Example:
App --> LuckyN --> Dice --> Die
                    L--> Die
